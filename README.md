# GraphQL Example API

This repository was created for my TechTalk on GraphQL at USPCodeLab's Winter School 2018 to serve as a simple example of how to create a GraphQL API from scratch using Koa and connecting to a MongoDB database.

## Docker

This repository is also configured to work on a Docker environment. To run it locally just use:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```
